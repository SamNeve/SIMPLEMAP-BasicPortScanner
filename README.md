# SIMPLEMAP-BasicPortScanner
This is a very simple port scanner that I learned how to make. It is not multithreaded so I would recommend keeping the range of scanned ports small.

# How to Install

```
git clone https://github.com/SamNeve/SIMPLEMAP-BasicPortScanner
```
## Step 2 
```
chmod +x Dependencies.sh
```
## Step 3

```
## Step 4 
```
python3 ./SIMPLEMAP.py
```
